# 👋 Hi, I'm Maura

I'm a physicist working at the intersection of theoretical research and data analysis. My background is in astrophysics, with experience in, dark matter interactions, and phase transitions in the early universe.

I'm currently exploring how to apply these skills to more general data problems — building a portfolio that combines scientific computing with core machine learning techniques.

# 👩‍🔬 Maura E. Ramirez-Quezada  
I'm a PhD physicist with experience on applying numerical methods to study complex physical systems — from dark matter in stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, to phase transitions in the early universe. I specialize in **scientific programming in Python**, **numerical modeling**, and **data analysis**.

Currently, I’m transitioning into the **data science and machine learning space**, leveraging a strong foundation in physics, coding, and problem solving to tackle new challenges at the interface of science and technology.

## 🌌 Research & Technical Highlights

These projects represent my most impactful academic contributions — each driven by custom-built numerical code, modeling pipelines, and extensive data analysis in Python.
- 🪐 **Dark Matter in Compact Stars**  
  Designed numerical tools to model DM capture and annihilation in white dwarfs and neutron stars. Explored luminosity from anomalous heating as an observable signature.
  
- 🧊 **White Dwarf Cooling via Neutrino Emission in Dark Sector Models**  
  Studied the impact of a dark photon in a three-portal model on the neutrino emission rates from white dwarfs. Derived constraints on dark sector parameters by comparing the predicted energy loss to astrophysical luminosity bounds.

- 🌀 **Thermal Phase Transitions in Hidden Sectors**  
  Developed Python-based simulations for studying first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Generated testable predictions for gravitational wave detectors like LISA and DECIGO.

- 🔌 **Thermal Leptogenesis Constraints from Neutrino Observables**  
  Performed numerical scans in a type-I seesaw framework with three heavy Majorana neutrinos. Used flavored density matrix formalism to derive the minimum heavy neutrino mass (\(M_1^{\rm min}\)) consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry, as a function of low-energy neutrino observables such as \(m_{\text{lightest}}\) and \(m_{\beta\beta}^{\rm eff}\).

As part of my transition into data science, I’ve developed and applied end-to-end ML workflows with the same analytical rigor I bring to physics research. My work includes:

- Preprocessing and cleaning real-world and synthetic datasets  
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction  
- Supervised learning with model comparison and performance evaluation  
- Unsupervised learning for clustering and pattern discovery  
- Anomaly detection under data imbalance  
- Workflow development using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`
